# data-summary
Cheatsheet for details about Harvard PGP Dataset

# ALL DETAILS WORK-IN-PROGRESS
and still need to be fact-checked!

## Useful Links

* Some graphs of the # genomes etc. https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data/statistics
* Participant profiles https://my.pgp-hms.org/users 
* Public data https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data (takes a while to load)

## Sources of Data

1) Internal

We release whole genomes. In terms of individuals,

* 10 Illumina (earliest).
* ~200 Complete Genomics.
* ~20 Complete Genomics Long Fragment Read (CG LFR).
* Find it here: https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data

2) External

* Participants can upload any type of data they want to.
* Data-type is self-reported, trust at your own risk.
* e.g. 23andMe, https://my.pgp-hms.org/public_genetic_data?utf8=%E2%9C%93&data_type=23andMe&commit=Search

3) Surveys

* Anyone enrolled (passed consent quiz) can take surveys
* Surveys can be taken multiple times
* Some subset will have their genome sequenced
* Cover everything from cancer to blood type
* Survey responses: https://my.pgp-hms.org/google_surveys
* Survey questions: https://github.com/PGPHarvard/pgp-surveys/tree/master/Surveys

4) Get-Evidence

* Research-uses only variant report returned to participants
* http://evidence.pgp-hms.org/genomes

5) Sample Collection Timestamps 

* https://my.pgp-hms.org/specimens 

6) Cell Lines

* Can be ordered from Coriell
* https://catalog.coriell.org/0/Sections/Collections/NIGMS/PGPs.aspx?PgId=772&coll=GM

## Misc. Of Interest

* Files can be publicly accessed / manipulated through Arvados
